## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 6 Part 2: I enjoyed coding a game of blackjack using bool statements and integers. Decoding all the bugs in my code was challenging, but that is my favorite coding aspect. The hardest part of the lesson was calculating the total score of the hand when one card could have many outputs like an ace can be 1 or 11.

Lab 7 Part 1: This has to be my 2nd favorite lab because we had to code what days and times we could park on set streets. We had to make functions for each street and set restrictions based on the time and days, then we would use bool statements to see if they met the required arguments. 

Lab 8 Part 1: My 3rd favorite lab was when we coded the Olympic judge average. We had to use the averaging algorithm and implement it with code. We used doubles and vectors to calculate the average using the remaining scores. This was a difficult lab to debug because I did not understand vectors that well at the time, after I completed debugging I felt a sense of accomplishment, making it my 3rd favorite lab.
