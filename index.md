## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 6 Part 2. I enjoyed coding a game of blackjack using bool statements and integers. Decoding all the bugs in my code was challenging, but that is my favorite coding aspect. The hardest part of the lesson was calculating the total score of the hand when one card could have many outputs like an ace can be 1 or 11.
